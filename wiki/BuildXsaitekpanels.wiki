I have my Linux development computer set up in the following manner.

On my home I have the folder

*xplugins*

In the xplugins folder I have these three folders

*SDK*

*hidapi-0.7.0*

*Xsaitekpanels*

The source code from this site go in the Xsaitekpanels folder and using the following commands will do this for you. Change bill to your computer home name.

cd /home/bill/xplugins

svn checkout http://xplugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Xsaitekpanels Xsaitekpanels

Now, there are some prerequisities to download...


 * * X Plane SDK 2.0.1 * - http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/XPSDK201.zip

 * * Signal11 / Hidapi * - https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/downloads/hidapi-0.7.0.zip 

Mac users may find this Hidapi to work better at this point in time.
