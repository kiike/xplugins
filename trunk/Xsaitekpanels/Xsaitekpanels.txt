*******************************************************************************************************
Backlight Information Panel

Here is a link to the bip panel web site http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/bip.html
The bip panel is fully supported:

It uses a Config file that resides in /Resources/plugins/Xsaitekpanels/D2B_config.txt.

Look at as a example of what is possible. The D2B_config.txt has two parts a default section and a test section.
The default section mimics the annunacator panel in a Cessna 172.
The test section test all the indicators when you select test and click on the annunacator test button.
Look at your /Resources/plugins/DataRefs.txt to see what data reference's are avaiable to you. 

The config file structure is as follows

Every line not starting with # is ignored. So please fill it with comments.

You can use the following commands in the config file:

*****************************************************************************************

#SET BIP A 0 G FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit/warnings/annunciator_test_pressed RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP A 1 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit/warnings/annunciators/low_voltage RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP A 2 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/fuel_quantity RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP A 3 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/controls/parking_brake_ratio RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP B 2 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/low_vacuum RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP B 3 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/autopilot_disconnect RANGE 1 TO 1

#SET BIP <a> <b> <c> FROM  DATAREF <d> RANGE <e> TO <f>

a) Which row with A being the top row A, B, C.
b) Position on the Row starting with 0. (0  -  7).
c) Which color do you want to display. G = Green, R = Red, A = Amber.
d) Data Reference to tell the indicator to turn on. 
e) First number to check.
f) Second number to check.

****************************************************************************************

#SET BIP B 0 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/oil_pressure_low 0 RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP A 0 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/generator_off 0 RANGE 1 TO 1
#SET BIP B 1 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/oil_temperature_high 0 RANGE 1 TO 1

#SET BIP <a> <b> <c> FROM ARRAY <d> <e> RANGE <f> <g> 
a) Which row with A being the top rom A, B, C.
b) Position on the Row starting with 0. (0  -  7).
c) Which color do you want to display. G = Green, R = Red, A = Amber.
d) Data Reference to tell the indicator to turn on. 
e) Array position. For multi engine 0 = first engine.
f) First number to check.
g) Second number to check.

Linux

Supported platforms at this release are Patched Ubuntu 10.10, Patched 11.04, and 11.04 with kernel 2.6.39 X-Plane 9.69 & 9.70 & 10.3. See my patch downloads for more info on what is needed. I am glad to announce that 11.10 runs this plugin unpatched and is my present testing version. Other versions may work but have not been tested. You will need to install a new 51-Xsaitekpanels.rules in /lib/udev/rules.d for these Saitek panels to be seen by this plugin. It is included in this archive.

****************************************************************************************************************

Windows

Supported and tested platforms at this release is Windows XP, Windows 7 and X-Plane 9.69 & 9.70 & 10.3. I would like to add more but I will have to get feedback as to what versions of Windows this is running on. When X-Plane initialy loads the radio and the multi panel may be dark. This is because initialy the switches are not read so do not know what to display. Move any switch on the radio or multi panel and if the battery and avionics switch are on they should display the appropriate. 

*******************************************************************************************************************

Mac

Thanks to Marcos Lemos and Steven King I now have support for the Mac. I have users using OSX 10.7 Lion Intel Only and another successful user with a switch and radio panel on a MacBook Pro that has OSX 10.6.8 on it (Thanks Sandy). I also now have a Intel MacBook user on OSX 10.5.8. When X-Plane initialy loads the radio and the multi panel may be dark. This is because initialy the switches are not read so do not know what to display. Move any switch on the radio or multi panel and if the battery and avionics switch are on they should display the appropriate.

********************************************************************************************************************

This project and my projects going forward will be open source and reside at http://code.google.com/p/xplugins/source/checkout for anyone interested in how A HID plugin is created for all platforms.

**********************************************************************************************************************

How to install.

This is a fat plugin so the folder named Xsaitekpanels which have a lin.xpl, win.xpl, mac.xpl, xsaitekpanels.prf and D2B_config.txt in it and needs to reside in /Resources/plugins/ folder. 

**********************************************************************************************************************

Ver 1.16 First version to support Linux and Windows.

Ver 1.17 Fixed bug that would crash X-Plane if Multi panel and Switch panel were not pluged in.

Ver 1.18 Updated the AP for the Multi panel. Added Mac support. Unresolved issue with the IAS button.

Ver 1.19 Fixed the IAS button issue. I tried to mimic the P180 Avanti but still may have issues with heavy metal.

Ver 1.20 Added support for the BIP panel. Fixed some bugs with the gear leds on the Switch Panel.

Ver 1.21 Fixed some bugs with the DME on the Radio Panel.

Ver 1.22 Added adjustable trim speeds on the Multi Panel.

Ver 1.23 Added option of two ADF's. Added Active/Standby for ADF's. Improved selection of frequency of ADF's.

Ver 1.24 Added checkmarks to selected menu items. Improved selection of codes for transponder.

Ver 1.25 Added menu option to invert bat alt on switch panel. Completly blank the multi panel when avionics or battery off.

Ver 1.26 Added menu option for multiple speeds on multi panel knob. Fixed bug with the cowl flaps on the switch panel.

Ver 1.27 Added preference file to allow user adjustable defaults. Changed master switch to completly turn off all panels like in a real plane.

Ver 1.28 Found a bug introduced in the last update with the ACT/STBY on the radio panels. Thanks Pasquale Faraco.

Ver 1.29 Added high speed multiplier for the multi panel silver knob. The multiplier is selected from the xsaitekpanels > multi menu selection. The high speed command can be mapped under Joystick,keys&equipment.

Ver 1.30 Corrected the ADF and XPDR digit selection to work in both directions. Before it only worked in the increase direction.

Ver 1.31 Lots of changes this version. On the radio panel corrected the ADF and XPDR digit selection so clockwise is right and counter is left. On the multi panel improved the CRS and HDG adjustments using data reference so should be more responsive. Removed the adjustable multiplier menu selection and made it 10X so when you use the high speed multiplier button it is 10 times faster. On the ALT switch changes so it is 100 feet normal and with the high speed button it is 1000 feet so you should be able to get the ALT dialed in very fast. With Michal's help the silver knobs and displays on the radio and multi panels are much more responsive without any lag or overtravel from slow FPS to fast FPS.

Ver 1.32 Changed the name of the multiplier button to Xpanels Fn Button to better reflect its new use. I have added a sync function to the HDG and CRS button. If you hold down the new Fn Button and also press the HDG button is will set the AP heading to the magnetic heading. The same is for the CRS button. Added a QNH function to the XPDR switch position to adjust the altimeter using the xpanelsfnbutton and the fine and course knobs. Added a set the altimeter to 2992 by pressing the xpanelsfnbutton and the ACT/STBY buttons as the same time. Pressing the ACT/STBY alone will cycle through the XPDR modes.  

Thanks for your Support Bill
